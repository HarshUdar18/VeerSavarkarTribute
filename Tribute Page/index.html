        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (28 May 1883 â€“ 26 February 1966), also known as Swatantryaveer Savarkar, was an Indian politician, activist, and writer. He is considered one of the pioneers of Hindutva, the ideology of Hindu nationalism. Savarkar was born in Bhagur, Maharashtra, India. He was educated at Fergusson College in Pune and the City Law School in London. While in London, he became involved in revolutionary activities against British rule in India. He was arrested in 1910 and imprisoned in the Andaman Islands for 16 years. After his release from prison, Savarkar became a leading figure in the Hindu Mahasabha, a political party that advocated for Hindutva. He was also a prolific writer, and his works on Hindutva and Indian nationalism are still influential today. Savarkar was a controversial figure, and his views on Hindutva have been criticized by some as being communalist. However, he is also revered by many as a freedom fighter and a champion of Hindu rights.
